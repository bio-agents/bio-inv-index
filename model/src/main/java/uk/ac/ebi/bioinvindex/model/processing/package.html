Provides classes for sample processing gragh.

<p>
    The graph structure is decoupled from the actual contents of the the graph. The graph structure consists of Nodes
    {@see uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.Node}
    and Edges {@see uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.Processing}.
</p>

<p>
    Nodes are represented by the following classes (subclasses of {@see
    uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.Node}) : {@see
    uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.MaterialNode},
    {@see uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.DataNode}. A graph node could either include a Material or
    Data.
    Hybridization is a subclass of Material.
    Examples of Materials are: Source, Sample, Extract, LabeledExtract and Hybridization distinguished by attribute
    {@see uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.term.MaterialRole} for each Material instance.
    Any of these could go inside a Material Node. Examples of data are: Scan, Normalization, ArrayData, ArrayDataMatrix,
    Image,
    DerivedArrayData, DerivedArrayDataMatrix distinguished by attribute {@see
    uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.term.DataType}
    for each Data instance. Similarly, each Data instance is included in a Data Node if it is part of the graph.
</p>

<p>
    Edges are represented by the following classes:
    {@see uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.MaterialProcessing}, {@see
    uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.DataProcessing}
    and {@see uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.DataAcquisition}. An edge between two Material nodes is an
    instance
    of MaterialProcessing. An edge between a Material node and a Data node (e.g. Hybridization to Scan or Data) is an
    instance of DataAcquisition. Similarly, an edge between two Data nodes is an instance of DataProcessing.
</p>

<p>
    If in the ISA-TAB file "Protocol REF" column is present between the transition from node to the next,
    a {@see uk.ac.ebi.bioinvindex.model.processing.ProtocolApplication} is instantiated and is added to its
    instance of Processing. More than one ProtocolApplication can be added to one Processing if more than one Protocol
    REF column
    exists between two nodes. If order is important, each ProtocolApplication can be given an order value.
